The first is on the categorization of texture words in the English language. The goal was to determine whether there is a common basis for subjects’ groupings of words related to visual texture, and if so, to identify the underlying dimensions used to categorize those words. Eleven major clusters were identified through hierarchical cluster analysis, ranging from ?random? to ?repetitive?. These clusters remained intact in a multidimensional scaling solution. The stress for a three-dimensional solution obtained through multidimensional scaling was 0.18, meaning that 82% of the variance in the data is explained through the use of three dimensions. It appears that the major dimensions of texture descriptors are repetitive versus nonrepetitive; linearly oriented versus circularly oriented; and simple versus complex. In the second experiment we measured the strength of association between texture words and texture images. The goal was to determine whether there is any systematic correspondence between the domains of texture words and texture images. Pearson's coefficient of contingency, a measure of the strength of association, was found to be 0.63 for words corresponding to given images and 0.56 for images corresponding to given words. Thus the texture categories in the verbal space and those in the visual space are strongly tied. In sum, our two experiments show (a) that despite the tremendous variety in the words we have to describe textures, there is an underlying structure to the lexical space which can be derived from the experimental data; and (b) that the association between a category of words and a category of images was strongest when both categories represent the same underlying property. This suggests that subjects' organizations of texture terms are systematically tied to their organization of texture images.}, number={2}, journal={Cognitive science}, publisher={Wiley}, author={Bhushan, Nalini and Rao, A.

 @unpublished{Cimpoi_Maji_Kokkinos_Mohamed_Vedaldi_2013, title={Describing Textures in the Wild}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3618}, abstractNote={Patterns and textures are defining characteristics of many natural objects: a shirt can be striped, the wings of a butterfly can be veined, and the skin of an animal can be scaly. Aiming at supporting this analytical dimension in image understanding, we address the challenging problem of describing textures with semantic attributes. We identify a rich vocabulary of forty-seven texture terms and use them to describe a large dataset of patterns collected in the wild.The resulting Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) is the basis to seek for the best texture representation for recognizing describable texture attributes in images. We port from object recognition to texture recognition the Improved Fisher Vector (IFV) and show that, surprisingly, it outperforms specialized texture descriptors not only on our problem, but also in established material recognition datasets. We also show that the describable attributes are excellent texture descriptors, transferring between datasets and tasks; in particular, combined with IFV, they significantly outperform the state-of-the-art by more than 8 percent on both FMD and KTHTIPS-2b benchmarks. We also demonstrate that they produce intuitive descriptions of materials and Internet images.}, journal={arXiv [cs.CV]}, author={Cimpoi, Mircea and Maji, Subhransu and Kokkinos, Iasonas and Mohamed, Sammy and Vedaldi, Andrea}, year={2013}, month={Nov} }

A typical eyespot (such as that of Bicyclus anynana) has a few concentric rings of dark and light colors and a white spot (called a focus) at the center. The prospective eyespot center during the early pupal stage is known to act as an organizing center. It has often been assumed, according to gradient models for positional information, that a white spot in adult wings corresponds to an organizing center and that the size of the white spot indicates how active that organizing center was. However, there is no supporting evidence for these assumptions. To evaluate the feasibility of these assumptions in nymphalid butterflies, we studied the unique color patterns of Calisto tasajera (Nymphalidae, Satyrinae), which have not been analyzed before in the literature. RESULTS: In the anterior forewing, one white spot was located at the center of an eyespot, but another white spot associated with either no or only a small eyespot was present in the adjacent compartment. The anterior hindwing contained two adjacent white spots not associated with eyespots, one of which showed a sparse pattern. The posterior hindwing contained two adjacent pear-shaped eyespots, and the white spots were located at the proximal side or even outside the eyespot bodies. The successive white spots within a single compartment along the midline in the posterior hindwing showed a possible trajectory of a positional determination process for the white spots. Several cases of focus-less eyespots in other nymphalid butterflies were also presented. CONCLUSIONS: These results argue for the uncoupling of white spots from eyespot bodies, suggesting that an eyespot organizing center does not necessarily differentiate into a white spot and that a prospective white spot does not necessarily signify organizing activity for an eyespot. Incorporation of these results in future models for butterfly wing color pattern formation is encouraged.}, number={1}, journal={SpringerPlus}, author={Iwata, Masaki and Otaki, Joji M.}, year={2016}, month={Aug}, pages={1287} }

 @unpublished{Kingma_Ba_2014, title={Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980}, abstractNote={We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.}, journal={arXiv [cs.LG]}, author={Kingma, Diederik P. and Ba, Jimmy}, year={2014}, month={Dec} }

Characterization of wing epithelial cells at these stages is thus critical to understand how wing structures, including color patterns, are determined. Previously, we successfully recorded real-time in vivo images of developing butterfly wings over time at the tissue level. In this study, we employed similar in vivo fluorescent imaging techniques to visualize developing wing epithelial cells in the late larval and early pupal stages 1 hour post-pupation. Both larval and pupal epithelial cells were rich in mitochondria and intracellular networks of endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting high metabolic activities, likely in preparation for cellular division, polyploidization, and differentiation. Larval epithelial cells in the wing imaginal disk were relatively large horizontally and tightly packed, whereas pupal epithelial cells were smaller and relatively loosely packed. Furthermore, larval cells were flat, whereas pupal cells were vertically elongated as deep as 130 μm. In pupal cells, many endosome-like or autophagosome-like structures were present in the cellular periphery down to approximately 10 μm in depth, and extensive epidermal feet or filopodia-like processes were observed a few micrometers deep from the cellular surface. Cells were clustered or bundled from approximately 50 μm in depth to deeper levels. From 60 μm to 80 μm in depth, horizontal connections between these clusters were observed. The prospective eyespot and marginal focus areas were resistant to fluorescent dyes, likely because of their non-flat cone-like structures with a relatively thick cuticle. These in vivo images provide important information with which to understand processes of epithelial cell differentiation and color pattern determination in butterfly wings.}, number={6}, journal={PloS one}, author={Ohno, Yoshikazu and Otaki, Joji M.}, year={2015}, month={Jun}, pages={e0128332} }

The 2D model uses evolved textures for prey, a background texture representing the environment, and a visual predator. A human observer, acting as the predator, is shown a cohort of 10 evolved textures overlaid on the background texture. The observer clicks on the five most conspicuous prey to remove (“eat”) them. These lower-fitness textures are removed from the population and replaced with newly bred textures. Biological morphogenesis is represented in this model by procedural texture synthesis. Nested expressions of generators and operators form a texture description language. Natural evolution is represented by genetic programming (GP), a variant of the genetic algorithm.

 @unpublished{Sandler_Zhmoginov_Luo_Mordvintsev_Randazzo_Arcas_2020, title={Image segmentation via Cellular Automata}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04965}, abstractNote={In this paper, we propose a new approach for building cellular automata to solve real-world segmentation problems. We design and train a cellular automaton that can successfully segment high-resolution images. We consider a colony that densely inhabits the pixel grid, and all cells are governed by a randomized update that uses the current state, the color, and the state of the $3times 3$ neighborhood. The space of possible rules is defined by a small neural network. The update rule is applied repeatedly in parallel to a large random subset of cells and after convergence is used to produce segmentation masks that are then back-propagated to learn the optimal update rules using standard gradient descent methods. We demonstrate that such models can be learned efficiently with only limited trajectory length and that they show remarkable ability to organize the information to produce a globally consistent segmentation result, using only local information exchange. From a practical perspective, our approach allows us to build very efficient models -- our smallest automaton uses less than 10,000 parameters to solve complex segmentation tasks.}, journal={arXiv [cs.CV]}, author={Sandler, Mark and Zhmoginov, Andrey and Luo, Liangcheng and Mordvintsev, Alexander and Randazzo, Ettore and Arcas, Blaise Agúera y.}, year={2020}, month={Aug} }
